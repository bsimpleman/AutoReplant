# AutoReplant

AutoReplant is a very lightweight farming plugin. This plugin allows crops to be automatically replanted, as long as the player has seeds in their inventory of the type matching the crop they harvested.

Currently no configurations, if there is a configuration you would like to have implemented please suggest it.

Permissions:
